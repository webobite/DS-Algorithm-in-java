## Navigate through the project
Every Algorithm will be written under specific package which is separated by the type of Algorithm it belongs to and Algorithm name will be file name for example.
```
Selection sort algorithm you can find in package named as
Package Name : com.sunday.session.sorting
File Name : SelectionSortAlgorithm.java
```
Other resources shared during discussion will be added in the folder named `discussion-resources` in root directory under topic named.

Happy Coding !!
